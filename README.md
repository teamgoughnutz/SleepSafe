# SleepSafe

Our project is called CitySearch...now.

You go the homepage and type in a city that you want to travel to and our advanced APIs return a google map of the location and some news articles. 

Our project leader was Cris Herrera. The rest of the team consist of Dylan Davidson, Jonathan Vargas, and Brandon Bernanrd
